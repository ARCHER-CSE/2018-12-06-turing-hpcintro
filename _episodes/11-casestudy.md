## Abstract

During my three month internship I worked on constructing complex mesoscopic surfaces. Surfaces are naturally heterogeneous and are currently not accurately simulated, resulting in poor understanding of surface-fluid interactions. The internship was focussed on developing a workflow which could generate complex surfaces with physical and chemical defects for mesoscopic simulations. The presentation summarises the work done across the internship and the future scope of the project.

## Bio

Iâ€™m currently entering the second year of my PhD after completing a 3 month internship with the IBM chemistry team. I am a student in the Theory and Simulation of Materials Centre of Doctoral Training (TSM-CDT) at Imperial College London and based within the chemistry department. The research I do investigates modelling the environmental decomposition of chemical warfare agents, in particular the nerve agent VX, across a range of time and length scales. Originally, I did my undergraduate at Lancaster University studying maths, chemistry and biology as part of the Natural Sciences degree scheme. After which, I moved both location and field, relocating to London and completing a masters in physics and material science with the TSM-CDT before progressing on to the PhD.
